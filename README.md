From the dataset I have solved some visualization problems using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn
1: Is there really such a thing as a home team advantage?
2: What 10 teams has the strongest defense, midfield, and offense players as per the data?
3: Which 10 teams has the most win according to the data?
